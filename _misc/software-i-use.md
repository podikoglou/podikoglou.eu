### Programming-related

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) -- Fast,
  [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)-compatible tool version manager. I use this to
  install and manage my versions of programs like compilers / runtimes, and
  other development-related tools.

- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) -- Batteries included, performant code and text
  editor. I use this as my primary code editor. I also sometimes use it for
  writing text.

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) -- Good fork of
  [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar). I mostly use this on my laptop.

- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) -- Efficient (Terminal)
  UI for Git. I am slowly moving more and more of my git workflow into it and it
  has greatly improved by efficiency.

- [Aider](https://aider.chat/) -- Terminal-based AI programming assistant. I
  use this when I need to either: _1)_ quickly create new tools / scripts, _2)_
  refactor a lot of code, _3)_ write a lot of repetitive code.

#### Language-related

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) -- Amazingly fast JavaScript Runtime & Package Manager.
  I try to use it when possible.

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) -- Python Package / Project manager which I
  use in the cases where I have to write Python (or use Python tools).

### System-related

- [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org) -- This is my Linux distro of choice,
  which I use on my laptop. It is dead simple and I've been using it for years
  with minimal issues.

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) -- Very extendable (rich ecosystem)
  program launcher for MacOS which I use on my home computer.

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) -- Terminal emulator. Apparently quite fast.

- [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) -- Terminal multiplexer / session manager. Not the
  most modern and perhaps not the best one (see: [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/)),
  but I've been using it for years and it has grown on me.

### Academia-related

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) -- Literature organizer which I use to
  organize and read papers.

- [Anki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)>) -- Spaced repetition
  software which I use to learn and periodically remind myself things.

### Personal life-related

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) -- Writing app / markdown file organizer. I
  use this for keeping notes about general life-related things. For example I
  have a note on there called "Places I want to live in for at least a month or
  two during my lifetime".
