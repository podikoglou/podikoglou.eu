# About Me

I'm a Computer Science student based in Thessaloniki. I spend most of my time
dabbling in different technologies and programming languages. I primarily enjoy
writing code in TypeScript, Rust and Go.

## Current Focus
I'm currently:
- doing my BSc in Computer Science in Thessaloniki
- going through [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)
- working on [superr](https://github.com/podikoglou/superr)
- learning Dutch

## Work

Some notable projects I've worked on include:

- a [TypeScript to C Transpiler](https://github.com/podikoglou/type-c): An
  experimental tool that translate C-like TypeScript code into C.

- a [Superoptimization Toolchain](https://github.com/podikoglou/superr): A
  program and library for experimenting with optimization algorithms.

## Interests

I enjoy learning about Linguistics, primarily Historical Linguistics. I am
naturally also attracted to _learning_ languages. I've been on my journey of
learning Dutch for the past year and a half, and I have briefly explored
Swedish and German.

## Background

I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. My father
worked with electronics, so naturally I was exposed to various technologies and
devices. I eventually got my first computer, which I managed to break in
various different ways within the first few weeks.

I started programming at 11 or 12. My first programming language was Java. Over
the next few years, I worked on dozens of projects and socialized and
collaborated with other programmers, which greatly helped me in my journey.
