# About Me

I'm a Computer Science student based in Thessaloniki. I spend most of my time
dabbling in different technologies and programming languages. I primarily enjoy
writing code in TypeScript, Rust and Go.

### Work

Some notable projects I've worked on include:

- a [TypeScript to C Transpiler](https://github.com/podikoglou/type-c): An
  experimental tool that translate C-like TypeScript code into C.
  [[Article]](https://podikoglou.gr/writing/002-transpiling-typescript-to-c)

- a [Superoptimization Toolchain](https://github.com/podikoglou/superr): A
  program and library for experimenting with optimization algorithms.

### Interests

I enjoy learning about Linguistics, primarily Historical Linguistics. Naturally,
I am also attracted to _learning_ languages. I've been on my journey into
learning Dutch for the past year and a half, and I have previously dabbled in
German and Swedish.

### Background

I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. My father
worked with electronics, so naturally I was exposed to various technologies and
devices. I eventually got my first computer, which I managed to break in
various different ways within the first few weeks.

I learned to program at 11 or 12. My first programming language was Java. Over
the next few years I worked on dozens of projects and socialized and
collaborated with other programmers, which greatly helped me in my journey.
