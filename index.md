# Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a Computer Science student from
[Thessaloniki](https://www.britannica.com/summary/Thessaloniki). I like to
dabble in different technologies and read about computers and linguistics. I'm
interested in Systems Programming and Distributed Systems. In the past I have
worked on numerous Java-based projects around Game Servers.
